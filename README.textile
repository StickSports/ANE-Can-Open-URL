h1. Air Native Extension for iOS and Android - Can Open URL

*Please note that we are no longer able to support this project and are not contributing to it.*

This is an "Air native extension":http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html to test whether an app is installed to handle a URL scheme on the iOS and Android platforms.

This extension enables checking for the existence of an app to handle any specified URL within an Air project. The extension has a single command that checks for a URL handler.

h3. Version

This is version 1.1 of this extension.

h3. Binary files

The bin folder contains the compiled extension and the default swc, which can be used for local testing if required by your development environment (Flash Builder shouldn't need it, but other IDEs may).

h3. Building

Requirements - Adobe Air SDK 3.1 or later, XCode IDE, Android SDK 2.2 or later, Java SDK, Apache Ant

* iOS
** Add the FlashRuntimeExtensions.h file from the Adobe Air sdk to the ios/CanOpenUrlIosExtension folder in the project.
* Android
** Add the FlashRuntimeExtensions.jar file from the Adobe Air sdk to the android/libs folder in the project.
* Create a copy of the build/example.build.config file in the build folder, calling it build.config and change the properties in this file to match your system.
** A certificate is required by the build script. This may be a self-signed certificate created by Adobe Air. This should not be an Apple developer certificate.
* Run the ant build script build.xml. This creates the native extension and default swc file inside the bin folder.

h3. The test project

A simple test project is included for testing the extension. To build this air project

* Run the ant build script test/build.xml. This creates the test ipa and apk apps inside the test/bin folder.

h3. Using the extension

h4. To find whether an app exists to open a specific URL -

@CanOpenUrl.canOpen( url : String ) : Boolean@

h3. Example code

You can see the feature in action in the source code of the test project.
