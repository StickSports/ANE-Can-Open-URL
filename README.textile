h1. Air Native Extension for iOS - Can Open URL

This is an "Air native extension":http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html to test whether an app is installed to handle a URL scheme on the iOS platform.

This extension enables checking for the existence of an app to handle any specified URL within an Air project. The extension has a single command that checks for a URL handler.

h3. Version

This is version 1.0 of this extension.

h3. Binary files

The bin folder contains the compiled extension and the default swc, which can be used for local testing if required by your development environment (Flash Builder shouldn't need it, but other IDEs may).

h3. Building

Requirements - Adobe Air SDK 3.1 or later, XCode IDE

* Add the FlashRuntimeExtensions.h file from the Adobe Air sdk to the ios/CanOpenUrlIosExtension folder in the project.
* Create a copy of the build/example.build.config file in the build folder, calling it build.config and change the properties in this file to match your system.
** A certificate is required by the build script. This may be a self-signed certificate created by Adobe Air. This should not be an Apple developer certificate.
* Run the ant build script build.xml. This creates the native extension and default swc file inside the bin folder.

h3. The test project

A simple test project is included for testing the extension. To build this air project

* Run the ant build script test/build.xml. This creates the test ipa inside the test/bin folder.

h3. Using the extension

h4. To find whether an app exists to open a specific URL -

@CanOpenUrl.canOpen( url : String ) : Boolean@

h3. Example code

You can see the feature in action in the source code of the test project.

h3. Compiling your project

This is an Air 3.1 extension. Specify the path to the iphone SDK when compiling the project, using the functionality built in to your IDE or the platformsdk parameter if building with adt from the command line or a build script.
